CWatchAPI

A library I created to connect to the CriticalWatch vuln scanning service we had.  This allowed me to integrate the data into
hawk in an automated way for vuln lookups with hawk.  Also created some hawk automations that allowed hawk to orchastrate to 
end point devices, whether firewalls,switchs,servers or just about anything you want to do on a incident.
